# news-embeddings
Generate embeddings of news articles using LLM such as OpenAI embeddings models.
These embeddings can be used as features in downstream prediction models. The embeddings can be used together with additional structured and unstructured data.
For example, news about a company can be a useful feature for a model that predicts the financial results in the coming quarter.
