# news-embeddings
Generate embeddings of news articles using LLM such as OpenAI embedding models. LLM generated embeddings contain more contextual meanings of words. This can be useful when there is not enough training data in the problem domain specific dataset to fully train the embeddings layer.
These embeddings can be used as features in downstream prediction models. The embeddings can be used together with additional structured and unstructured data.
For example, news embeddings about a company can be combined with financial and economical indicators as features for a model that predicts the financial results in the coming quarter.
